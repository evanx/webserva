Further to my #BotPrize entry @WebServaBot, which uses Telegram for authentication and authorisation for https://webserva.com/about - the "About" page for this site redirects to https://github.com/evanx/webserva/blob/master/README.md, which provides a more detailed description. The idea was to leverage the Telegram bot platform for auth, to avoid the usual web-based signup, verify email and signin. Rather, a /signup message to @WebServaBot from a Telegram.org user is sufficient, and thereafter /login to create a magic login link via the @WebServaBot. As such the user authentication is effectively delegated to Telegram.org. Moreover client certs can be authorised by the @WebServaBot as well. These are created using an openssl script advised by the bot, and tailored according to the Telegram username, to make it as simple as possible, e.g. https://webserva.com/cert-script/evanxsummers advised on /signup. The bot commands /grant, /list and /revoke, are used for authorisation of client certs for https://secure.webserva.com. Incidently some of this work is being generalised for re-use by myself (and potentially other bot builders) via some of my other github projects e.g. https://github.com/evanx/webhook-publish and https://github.com/evanx/telegrambot-auth. Thank you for considering my submission. I have enjoyed working with the Telegram bot API this year, and it has been a great learning experience. Evan
